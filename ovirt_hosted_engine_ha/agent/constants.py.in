# Metadata can be parsed by agents as old as METADATA_PARSE_VERSION, but may
# contain new/additional information as new as METADATA_FEATURE_VERSION.  This
# allows detection of enhancements without breaking backwards compatibility.
#
# Note: The range of valid metadata versions for this host is from
# METADATA_PARSE_VERSION <= version <= METADATA_FEATURE_VERSION.  If an
# incompatible change is made to the metadata, both the parse and feature
# versions should be raised beyond the current feature version.  This will
# ensure that a) the old agent will recognize that it has been superseded
# and shut down the vm, and b) the newer agents will ignore the older agents'
# reported scores, thus assuming control of the vm.
